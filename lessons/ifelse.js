whatever is in the variable (let age= 17) is what it is working with. so because 
im looking for greater than 17 it comes back saying that you arnt old enough. 
if i change the variable to be 18 it will say i can serve you. 

let Country = "UK";
let age = 18;

if (age > 17 && Country == "UK"){
console.log("i can serve you");
}
else {
console.log("you arnt old enough");
}

added an extra variable to the above to make it more complex. 
if the country is changed to anything elese it will say you arnt old enough. 
and if both vaibales are met then it will be i can serve you */
